    At the break of dawn, with a gentle, cool breeze brushing against our skin, we hoisted our backpacks and set off along the deserted sidewalk, faces aglow in the emerging sunlight.

    While the primary allure of this trip was the Chōjirō-dani, our research revealed that the trailhead was located at Keyakidaira, the terminus of the Kurobe Gorge Railway. The mere mention of this gorge and railway had long captivated my imagination. Previously, logistical challenges had prevented me from including this destination in my travels. This unexpected opportunity was both surprising and delightful. To access Kurobe Gorge, we first took the Shinkansen to Kurobe, then transferred to the Toyama Chihō Railway. During my last visit to the Hokuriku region, the Shinkansen hadn’t yet reached Kanazawa. As our plane descended into Komatsu Airport, we could clearly see the long concrete viaduct stretching across the fertile Kanazawa Plain. “That’s the Shinkansen!” Terry exclaimed, eyes gleaming. The Hokuriku Shinkansen is set to extend to Tsuruga next spring, with plans to eventually reach Osaka. On the first morning of our journey to Ura-Tsurugi, traveling from Kanazawa to Shin-Kurobe marked my second experience on the Hokuriku Shinkansen.

    Shin-Kurobe isn’t located in the city center but at the edge of the alluvial fan where the Kurobe River enters the coastal plain. In fact, Shin-Kurobe isn’t the name of the Shinkansen station; it’s a new station established by the Toyama Chihō Railway to facilitate transfers to the Shinkansen. The Shinkansen station is named “Kurobe-Unazuki Onsen,” indicating that disembarking here provides access to either Kurobe City or the renowned tourist destination, Unazuki Onsen. The Toyama Chihō Railway doesn’t directly connect to Kurobe Gorge, so we first headed east to Unazuki Onsen, situated at the mouth of the gorge, to transfer.

    I had previously traveled on the Toyama Chihō Railway to the Tateyama area to the south. However, that trip wasn’t for mountain climbing but to experience the series of breathtaking transportation and infrastructure projects that traverse the Hida Mountains, known as the “Northern Alps.” This journey included witnessing the towering snow walls of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route in late spring and the still snow-covered Kurobe Dam. The snow corridor at Murodō, the highest point of the route, is the starting point for the popular ascent of Tsurugi-dake. In the film “<i>Tsurugidake: Ten no Ki</i>,” the survey team frequently used Murodō as a base to explore routes to the summit. At that time, I was unaware of Tsurugi-dake’s significance and didn’t realize Murodō’s geographical and historical importance in mountaineering and surveying. Moreover, that day was shrouded in thick fog, obscuring any view of the surrounding peaks. Reflecting on past travels, many destinations were merely superficial visits, lacking deeper understanding beyond what met the eye — a regrettable oversight. However, meticulously preparing for a trip can sometimes feel overly deliberate.

    Since the onset of the pandemic, which curtailed international travel, I’ve often pondered how to reconcile this dilemma. Recently, I read travel writer Chen Lang’s recommendation for the new Chinese translation of Nicolas Bouvier’s “<i>The Way of the World.</i>” He wrote, “<i>Travelers may not spend their entire lives on the road, but reflections on travel are endless. Therefore, we need to read to help find the missing words in our lives.</i>” This passage led me to consider repositioning travel from an “escape from daily life” to an “extension of daily life,” with reading as the means to achieve this. I believe that embracing a wealth of knowledge and insights enables us to fully comprehend and openly accept all unfamiliar experiences encountered during our journeys.

    The golden sun finally climbed over the mountains, its rays turning the eastern valley’s mist a warm yellow and casting a distorted glow on the western horizon. The two-car train swayed along the single-track line, the sharp sounds of steel clashing and grinding growing louder. As the driver’s face became clearer, the journey’s beginning felt almost surreal.

    Inside the old-fashioned carriage, there were more passengers than expected. Alongside uniformed middle school students, there were a few travelers. Most memorable were two young men poring over a map.

    In today’s digital age, few rely on paper materials for travel, and even fewer use traditional maps adorned only with contour lines and landmarks. I, too, prefer the old-school approach of carrying a paper map during hikes or trips. It offers a slow, tangible sense of progress, allowing me to understand how each step leads to the present moment. However, it’s challenging to resist the convenience of digital devices and information. Seeing individuals genuinely embracing traditional travel methods evokes a deep sense of admiration. For this climb up Tsurugi-dake, I brought along a paper map from Shōbunsha, which I had asked Alan, who arrived in Japan a week earlier, to purchase. Despite the map containing comprehensive information about our route, I couldn’t help but plan the trip on Yamareco before departure and even created a digital map using GIS software, overlaying the route on a topographic map from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, stored on my phone as a backup.
    <br><br>
    From the cutting-edge Shinkansen to local railways facing declining ridership due to population shifts and road development; from apps with instant positioning and zooming capabilities to the tangible heft of a foldable map — our journey toward Tsurugi-dake felt like a nostalgic return to bygone days.

    Passing by several abandoned, unstaffed station buildings, the houses and scenery along the railway exuded a strong rural charm, as if frozen in the prime years of an old man watching trains from his yard. Soon, the river narrowed rapidly with the terrain, and the train plunged into dense forests and dark tunnels. Before long, we arrived at Unazuki Onsen.
